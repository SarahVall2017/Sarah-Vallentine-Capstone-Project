Developed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, Java Bunny is a fictional, Louisville, KY based rabbit cafe where visitors can enjoy a variety of treats, and spend time with the cafeâ€™s furry residents. 
This project draws inspiration from various animal cafes in Japan, and is designed with both fun and minimalism in mind. Visitors to the site are also encouraged to join the mailing list for cool
rewards, or send comments via the contact page. Lastly, they can also check out the link provided for https://rabbit.org/rescue/rabbit-rescue-groups/, which shows rabbit rescue groups in Kentucky
and neighboring states if they are interested in a bringing home a furry friend.

 The features implemented in this site are as follows...
 
1. Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it (in all cases prevent invalid input from being stored or saved) ...
   This is the screen where visitors can sign up via e-mail to receive Java Bunny rewards. If invalid info is entered, the user is informed.

2. Visualize data in a user friendly way. (e.g. graph, chart, etc)...
   Located on the "Meet Our Bunnies" page, this donut chart shows visitors how many rabbit rescues are in Kentucky and neighboring states.
   A link is also provided for rabbit rescues across the United States https://rabbit.org/rescue/rabbit-rescue-groups/.

3. Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app...
   Using data object manipulation, I added a google map with an API key to show the fictional location of the cafe'.
   (NO I-FRAMES!)

4. Create a form and store the submitted values using an external API (e.g. a contact form, survey, etc)...
   On the Contact page, visitors to the site can leave their full name, e-mail, phone number, and comments.
